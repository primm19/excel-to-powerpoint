# excel-to-powerpoint
A small Python project which allows one to pull data from a specific excel file and output the data into a powerpoint project.

Initially there were plans to allow functionality for this program to find images in the file directory and output those onto PowerPoint slides, however such functionality has not been implemented yet.
There are also plans to get this program to work with any excel files with any filename in the directory.
Ideally this would scale the range of cells to pick from based on what's in each excel file, such code has not been implemented as of yet.
