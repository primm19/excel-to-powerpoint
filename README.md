# excel-to-powerpoint
A small Python project which allows one to pull data from a specific excel file and output the data into a powerpoint project.

This program also allows images to be inserted into each slide as long as images are named in the order by the slide that they should appear on. (As an example, the first slide is an introductory slide with no images, so we skip the numbers 0 and 1 and start by naming the first official picture to be included "2.jpg" since this photo will be included on the second slide of the presentation.)

The program configures the slides to appear as I want, allowing seemless project creation with slide-wise edits everytime the project is exported using this program.
